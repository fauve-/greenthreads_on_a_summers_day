Trying to implement semaphores on top of greenthreads.
I jacked the inital greenthread implementation from (http://c9x.me/art/gthreads/intro.html)
I'm sorry for what I have done to your code.

just a fun project to while away an afternoon and learn about concurrency primitives.



###stuff to do l8r:
figure out if the scheduler should await all routines before exiting the program
maybe implement channels
allow multiple worker threads to execute greenthreads (rofl good luck)
